# Chapter 7: Regular Expressions
* The methods that work with regular expressions are `regexp.exec`, `regexp.test`, `string.match`, `string.replace`, `string.search`, and `string.split`.
* The `(?:...)?` indicates an optional noncapturing group. It is usually better to use noncapturing groups instead of the less ugly capturing groups because capturing has a performance penalty.
